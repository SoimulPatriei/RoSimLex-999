## The RoSimlex-999 data and code
This is the data and the code for the paper "Evaluating computational models of similarity against a human rated dataset". \
The code has been tested on **Mac OS X** and **Linux**.

### Prerequisites
1. **Python** 3.6.10 or higher. We recommend to install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution. 
In any case you have to have NumPy and SciPy installed.
2. If you want to reproduce the corpus based results you need to install more things (See bellow)

### Data
1. If you prefer the data in Speadsheet format you can download it from here: [RoSimlex-999 Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QFNIVBmoLonLhr0mRO_jeTciIExD0X4Wa06XWAX5T5U/edit?usp=sharing)
2. You can find the data in text format under the "Data" directory. 
  - *RoSimlex-Final.txt*  contains the original Simlex-999 set, the Romanian mappings, 
the human scores and the scores computed from corpora embeddings and the semantic networks.
  - *RoSimlex-Maximal.txt*  is the common set
